# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game written in Rust. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.

## How to Play

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Janmesh23/rustSolana.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd guessing_game
    ```
3.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

The program will then prompt you to enter your guess. After each guess, it will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. When you guess the correct number, the game will end.
